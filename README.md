# Pavilion Design Documentation
www.memostudio.design

## Project Overview
This documentation outlines the design and implementation of a modern pavilion structure. The pavilion combines innovative architectural elements with functional spaces, creating an engaging public environment.

## Components
1. **Framework**: Core structural system and spatial organization
2. **Columns**: Organic columns with precise roof intersection details
3. **Roof**: Double-curved surface with contour line detailing
4. **Seating**: Vertically stacked S-curve seating elements
5. **Finishing**: Material specifications and connection details
6. **Renderings**: 3D visualization with material studies

## Key Features
- Fluid geometric forms with precise intersections
- Double-curved roof surface with contour highlighting
- Vertically stacked seating design
- Organic column-roof connections
- Interactive public spaces
- Sustainable materials

## Technical Specifications
- Overall Dimensions: 12m x 8m x 4.5m
- Material: High-grade aluminum and steel
- Surface Treatment: Anodized finish with contour detailing
- Column Details: Precise roof intersection with transition elements
- Seating: Dual-layer S-curve design with vertical supports
- Ground Anchoring: Reinforced foundation points

## Design Philosophy
The pavilion embodies a harmonious blend of form and function, featuring precise geometric intersections and thoughtful detailing. Each component is carefully designed to contribute to the overall aesthetic while maintaining structural integrity. The double-curved roof surface is highlighted by contour lines, while the seating elements create dynamic social spaces through vertically stacked S-curves.

## Implementation Guide
Refer to the individual component documentation for detailed specifications and implementation guidelines:
- Framework: Base structure and spatial organization
- Columns: Organic support system with precise roof intersection details
- Roof: Double-curved canopy with contour line highlighting
- Seating: Vertically stacked S-curve design with connecting elements
- Finishing: Material details and connection resolution
- Renderings: Visualization studies with material effects

## Parameters
All dimensional and material parameters are defined in the parameters.json file. These values can be adjusted to modify the pavilion's characteristics while maintaining design integrity. Key parameters include:
- Column-roof intersection details
- Roof surface curvature and contour spacing
- Seating vertical spacing and support placement
- Material specifications and finish details
