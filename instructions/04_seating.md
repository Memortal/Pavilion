# 4. Integrated Seating Element Creation

## Surface Extension Selection

### Transition Zone
1. Identify suitable roof edge:
   ```
   Criteria:
   - Minimum length: 2000mm
   - Height range: 2500-3000mm from ground
   - Clear approach path required
   - Smooth boundary curve integration
   - G2 continuity maintained at transition points
   ```

2. Extract boundary curve:
   - Use roof edge curve
   - Verify G2 continuity
   - Mark transition points

## Ground Connection

### Surface Flow
1. Create transition surface:
   ```
   Parameters:
   - Start height: Matches roof edge
   - End height: 450mm (ergonomic seating height)
   - Length: 2000mm
   - Surface continuity maintained through guide curves
   - Ergonomic transitions verified
   ```

2. Blending procedure:
   - Use guide curves for flow
   - Maintain surface continuity
   - Ensure ergonomic transitions

## Seating Geometry

### Profile Development

   ```
   Dimensions:
   - Seat depth: 450mm
   - Back angle: 7 degrees
   - Edge radius: 50mm
   - Base thickness: 80mm
   - Edge thickness: 50mm
   - Support thickness: 150mm
   ```

2. Surface thickening:
   ```
   Parameters:
   - Base thickness: 80mm
   - Edge thickness: 50mm
   - Support thickness: 150mm
   ```

## Ground Integration

### Base Connection
1. Create ground blend:
   ```
   Blend Properties:
   - Radius: 300mm
   - Ground contact width: 600mm
   - Internal support ribs for stability
   - Visual lightness maintained
   ```

2. Structural support:
   - Add internal ribs
   - Ensure stability
   - Maintain visual lightness

## Ergonomic Refinement

### Comfort Features
1. Surface sculpting:
   ```
   - Surface concavity: 50mm
   - Edge softening: 25mm radius
   - Integrated drainage slopes
   - Clear sight lines verified
   - Universal accessibility maintained
   ```

2. User interaction:
   - Check sight lines
   - Verify accessibility
   - Ensure comfort for various users

## Validation Checks
